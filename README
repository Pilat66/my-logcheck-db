My personal collection of custom logcheck rules
===============================================

1) Check the repository into a location like:

    /etc/logcheck/custom.ignore.d
    
2) Run 

    ``/etc/logcheck/custom.ignore.d/sync.py``
    
   This will link the custom rule files into the appropriate logcheck
   ignore directories.
    
   Note that by default it will assume to be located in a directory
   within a standard ``/etc/logcheck`` directory structure, and will
   sync the rules of the SYSTEM EVENTS layer into all report levels
   (workstation, server, paranoid).
